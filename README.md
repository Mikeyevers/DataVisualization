# DataVisualization
School assignment about Data Visualization

## Summary
This project visualizes the data out of the Air Bnb website/app. It describes all kind of correlations / insights for the city Amsterdam.
Airbnb had an enormous growth in Amsterdam the last few years. The local government of Amsterdam and legislators decided that a house can only be rent for 60 days a year, without paying tax. Other researches indicated that a lot of hosts changed their accommodation from “house” to something like “room” because this legislation doesn’t apply for a single room when the rest of the house is inhabited by the host. 
With this construction some hosts try to avoid the legislation, and so they are running an illegal business. 
With my visualization project I want to discover if I can tell something about those hosts or the illegal businesses they are running. How many illegal businesses are located in Amsterdam? What quality do they offer? Are they located in only specific area’s? etcetera.
I think it’s really useful to know this, because Amsterdam has an enormous struggle to keep the Airbnb’s under control. When there is more information about illegal businesses the Airbnb consumers can decided to avoid them and rent the best alternative or the local government and legislators can prosecute the hosts.
