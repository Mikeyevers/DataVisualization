# DataVisualization
School assignment about Data Visualization

## Summary
This project visualizes the data out of the Air Bnb website/app. It describes all kind of correlations / insights for the city Amsterdam. For example which accommodations are the cheapest and which give the best value for your money.
There is a possibility that the project will be expanded with another city (Groningen i.e).


## Design 
Todo: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization
after collecting feedback

## Feedback
Todo: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from
the first sketch to the final visualization

## Resources
I gathered multiple CSV files from this website: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
Each csv file represents a single “survey” or “scrape” of the Airbnb website.
